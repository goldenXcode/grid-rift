Code snippets

To Read the serialized file into Grid-Rift itself
~~~~~~~~~~~
Serializer serializer = new Persister();
File source = new File("example.xml");

Level lev = serializer.read(Level.class, source);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Level class should have a LinkedList inside so iterate through that and take the x and y Locations from teh glorified struct-class-thing Location.

If it blows up somehow use the earlier version Level_n.java

Btw, regarding the mock XML file, if you wanna make more coordinates just add 60 to the x and 30 to the y.
Can't guarantee there won't be overlap what with manual editing and all.
